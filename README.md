## ASAP!

So you are working at a company called `NeverEnding Inc.` as a `Software Person` and you are responsible for the company's blog application which runs on Django and use MYSQL as a database.

One day your boss comes and tells you this:

![](https://github.com/systemcraftsman/debezium-demo/blob/main/images/os_boss.jpg)

So getting the `command` from your boss, you think that this is a good use case for using Change Data Capture (CDC) pattern.

Since the boss wants it ASAP, you have to find a way to apply this request easily and you think it will be best to implement it via [Debezium](https://debezium.io/) on your `OpenShift Office Space` cluster along with [Strimzi: Kafka on Kubernetes](https://strimzi.io/).

Oh, you can wear a [Hawaiian shirt and jeans](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/office_space/quotes/) while you are doing all these even if it's not Friday:)

### Deploying a Kafka cluster with Strimzi Kafka CLI

In order to install Strimzi cluster on OpenShift you decide to use use [Strimzi Kafka CLI](https://github.com/systemcraftsman/strimzi-kafka-cli) which you can also install the operator of it.

First install the Strimzi operator:

```shell
kfk operator --install -n debezium-demo
```

---
**IMPORTANT**

If you have already an operator installed, please check the version. If the Strimzi version you've been using is older than 0.20.0, you have to set the right version as an environment variable, so that you will be able to use the right version of cluster custom resource. 

```shell
export STRIMZI_KAFKA_CLI_STRIMZI_VERSION=0.19.0
```

---

Let's create a Kafka cluster called `demo` on our OpenShift namespace `debezium-demo`. 

```shell
kfk clusters --create --cluster demo -n debezium-demo
```

In the opened editor you may choose 3 broker, 3 zookeeper configuration which is the default. So after saving the configuration file of the Kafka cluster in the developer preview of OpenShift you should see the resources that are created for the Kafka cluster:

![](https://github.com/systemcraftsman/debezium-demo/blob/main/images/strimzi_kafka_cluster.png)

### Deploying a Kafka Connect Cluster for Debezium

Now it's time to create a Kafka Connect cluster via using Strimzi custom resources. Since Strimzi Kafka CLI is not capable of creating connect objects yet at the time of writing this article we will create it by using the sample resources in the demo project.

Create a custom resource like the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
kind: KafkaConnect
metadata:
  annotations:
    strimzi.io/use-connector-resources: 'true'
  name: debezium
spec:
  bootstrapServers: 'demo-kafka-bootstrap:9092'
  config:
    config.storage.replication.factor: '1'
    config.storage.topic: debezium-cluster-configs
    group.id: debezium-cluster
    offset.storage.replication.factor: '1'
    offset.storage.topic: debezium-cluster-offsets
    status.storage.replication.factor: '1'
    status.storage.topic: debezium-cluster-status
  image: 'quay.io/hguerreroo/rhi-cdc-connect:2020-Q3'
  jvmOptions:
    gcLoggingEnabled: false
  replicas: 1
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: 2Gi
    requests:
      memory: 2Gi
```
And apply it to OpenShift `debezium-demo` namespace (or just apply the one you have in this demo repository)

```shell
oc apply -f resources/kafka-connect-debezium.yaml -n debezium-demo
```

This will create a Kafka Connect cluster with the name `debezium` on your namespace:

![](https://github.com/systemcraftsman/debezium-demo/blob/main/images/debezium_connect.png)

### Deploy a Debezium connector for MySQL

So you have the Kafka Connect cluster to be able to use with Debezium. Now it's time for the real magic; the Debezium connector for MySQL.

Create the custom resource like the following, by noticing the parts of configuration starts with `database`. 

Since you have to capture the changes in the `neverendingblog` database which has the `posts` database your configuration should be something like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaConnector
metadata:
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: debezium
  name: debezium-mysql-connector
spec:
  class: io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector
  config:
    database.server.name: db
    database.hostname: mysql
    database.user: debezium
    database.password: dbz
    database.server.id: '184054'
    database.port: '3306'
    database.dbname: neverendingblog
    database.history.kafka.topic: db.history
    database.history.kafka.bootstrap.servers: 'demo-kafka-bootstrap:9092'
  tasksMax: 1
```

Apply this YAML by saving it or just run the following command in this repository:

```shell
oc apply -f resources/kafka-connector-mysql-debezium.yaml -n debezium-demo
```

So you should now have some `action` in your Kafka cluster by now.

In order to see if there is any new topic is created in your Kafka cluster run this command to list the topics in the `debezium-demo` namespace and `demo` Kafka cluster:

```shell
kfk topics --list -n debezium-demo -c demo
```

So you should see some topics are created for you:

```

```

Now let's check this connector works or not. So start a consumer that listens your `db.neverendingblog.posts` topic which the captured data from `posts` topic is put.

```shell
kfk console-consumer --topic db.neverendingblog.posts -n debezium-demo -c demo
```

After starting the consumer let's make some changes in the `NeverEnding Blog`. Open the Django admin page by getting the route URL of the blog and putting  a "/admin" at the end.

---
**INFO**

You can get the route URL of your application with the following command:

```shell
oc get routes
```
---

So login to the admin page with the credentials `mabulgu/123456` and click on `Posts` and add a new one by clicking `Add Post` and put these values as a test and save it:

![](https://github.com/systemcraftsman/debezium-demo/blob/main/images/blog_add_post.png)

In the consumer you must already have seen a move right? Copy that into a JSON beautifier and see what you have. You must have something like this:

```json

  "schema": {
    "type": "struct",
    "fields": [

So congratulations! You can capture changes on your `neverendingblog` database. 

![](https://github.com/systemcraftsman/debezium-demo/blob/main/images/connector_mysql_to_kafka.png)

But your boss still wants you to put these changes on your search system `Elasticsearch`. 


Before rolling the sleeves to send this change data to Elasticsearch let's purify this data since all you need to index is the `operation type` and the table fields in this Debezium JSON data.
### Simple Data Transformation

So in order to transform the data some key/value converters has to be set in order to do `extract` transformation which will create a different data model in the end.

So add these lines and apply it on your OpenShift cluster:

```yaml
    key.converter: org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter
    key.converter.schemas.enable: 'false'
    value.converter: org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter
    value.converter.schemas.enable: 'false'
    transforms: extract
    transforms.extract.add.fields: 'op,table'
    transforms.extract.type: io.debezium.transforms.ExtractNewRecordState
```

Or just run this sample in the repository:

```shell
oc apply -f resources/kafka-connector-mysql-debezium_transformed.yaml -n debezium-demo
```

This means that we will extract the data for `op` and `table` fields and create a new JSON to be returned.

After applying the changes let's consume the messages again if we did stop the consumer already:

`kfk console-consumer --topic db.neverendingblog.posts -n debezium-demo -c demo`

Go to the blog admin page again but this time let's change one of the blog posts instead of adding one.

Edit the post titled `Strimzi Kafka CLI: Managing Strimzi in a Kafka Native Way` and put a "CHANGED -" at the very start of the body for example.

When you change the data, a relatively smaller JSON data must have been consumed in your console, something like this:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "title": "Strimzi Kafka CLI: Managing Strimzi in a Kafka Native Way",
  "text": "CHANGED - Strimzi Kafka CLI is a CLI that helps traditional Apache Kafka users -mostly administrators- to easily adapt Strimzi, a Kubernetes operator for Apache Kafka.\r\n\r\nIntention here is to ramp up Strimzi usage by creating a similar CLI experience with traditional Apache Kafka binaries. \r\n\r\nkfk command stands for the usual kafka-* prefix of the Apache Kafka runnable files which are located in bin directory. There are options provided like topics, console-consumer, etc. which also mostly stand for the rest of the runnable file names like kafka-topic.sh.\r\n\r\nHowever, because of the nature of Strimzi and its capabilities, there are also unusual options like clusters which is used for cluster configuration or users which is used for user management and configuration.",
  "created_date": 1594644431000000,
  "published_date": 1594644489000000,
  "author_id": 1,
  "__op": "u",
  "__table": "posts"
}

```

So this will be the data that you will index in Elasticsearch. Now let's go for it!

### Deploying a Kafka Connect Cluster for Camel

In order to use another connector that consumes the data from Kafka and puts it onto Elasticsearch, first we need another Kafka Connect cluster, this time for a Camel connector.

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
kind: KafkaConnect
metadata:
  annotations:
    strimzi.io/use-connector-resources: 'true'
  name: camel
spec:
  bootstrapServers: 'demo-kafka-bootstrap:9092'
  config:
    config.storage.replication.factor: '1'
    config.storage.topic: camel-cluster-configs
    group.id: camel-cluster
    offset.storage.replication.factor: '1'
    offset.storage.topic: camel-cluster-offsets
    status.storage.replication.factor: '1'
    status.storage.topic: camel-cluster-status
  image: 'quay.io/hguerreroo/camel-kafka-connect:0.5.0'
  jvmOptions:
    gcLoggingEnabled: false
  replicas: 1
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: 2Gi
    requests:
      memory: 2Gi
```

Saving or apply this YAML to your OpenShift namespace or just simply run this sample:

```shell
oc apply -f resources/kafka-connect-camel.yaml -n debezium-demo
```

This will create a Kafka Connect cluster with the name `camel` on your namespace:
